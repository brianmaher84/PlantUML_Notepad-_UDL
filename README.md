# PlantUML_Notepad-_UDL
This project is to contain a user definied language (UDL) for Notepad++ to support the PlantUML language syntax.

So far this works for all diagrams I have made but you may experience issues and please contribute.

I have not implemented code folding support here.  Just the highlighting of keywords and basic operators.
